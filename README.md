# Monkey Hammer

This repository is intended to contain a collection of
quick and dirty code generators, formatters, and the
combined detrious of my long career as a software developer, 
sometimes working in absurdly strict coding conventions.

None of this code is pretty, or production quality.

Use at your own risk, as it is always in a state of flux
and broken neglect.
